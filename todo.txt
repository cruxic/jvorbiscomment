Basic GUI
- field name should default to first unused field (this makes sense because fields are sorted by frequency of use)
- Could save field names that the user has added as a convenience feature
- remove </html> in about text
- title in add/edit field dialog
- show parse warnings
- show audio properties such as play time and bitrate
